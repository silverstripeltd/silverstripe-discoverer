 * $targetQueryStringField and $targetQueryUrl fields:

 * Search suggestions are often used as links back to a search form. In order to do that, you need to know where the
 * form is localed (a page URL in many cases) and what field is used for holding the search query string. These fields
 * are not automatically populated, but you can populate them if you would like to keep that information localised to
 * the Suggestions object, so that it might be easier for you to access them in your template (or wherever you need
 * them)
 *
 * See also: Suggestions.ss for an example of how these fields are implemented to create links back to a search form
